                <p class="who-body">
                    When shopping online for clothes, people can find it difficult to choose
                    what to buy or if the clothes would look good on them. If they order an item they don’t end up
                    liking, they would have to go through the process of returning it and reordering something else.
                    Even when choosing what outfit to wear for the day or for an event, they can go through multiple
                    different outfits and combinations before deciding on which one they like best. This can be very
                    time consuming and end with a bunch of clothes lying on the ground.</p>

                <h1 class="who-title">Motivation Using VR</h1>
                <p class="who-body">
                    AR technology can be used to superimpose images of clothing onto a person’s body, effectively
                    dressing them up like they would in real life. The app could be used to dress up other people in the
                    room, or use a mirror to dress themselves. VR technology can also be used to create a representation
                    of a person and place clothing on the avatar. The user could place the avatar in virtual
                    environments such as a wedding venue and see how the wedding dress would look at the location. The
                    user would also be able to change the avatar’s body type to see how the clothes would fit on a
                    larger or slimmer figure.

                <h1 class="who-title">Solution</h1>
                <p class="who-body">
                    Our solution will be composed of both VR and AR solutions. We plan on using smartphones (primarily
                    iOS devices) and VR headsets (Quest 2) for devices. The AR solution will focus on scanning the body
                    of the person to create a 3D model of them, which will most likely rely on photogrammetry, which
                    then can be imported into the VR application. We will also implement a light/quick preview to show
                    pieces of clothing applied to the person, where applicable, such as replacing their shoes or
                    anything viewable from the rear camera of the smartphone. The VR part of the application allows the
                    user to interact with their 3D model of themselves or any 3D model that they want to import, and
                    allow them to change the clothing on that model to anything they want. The user will also be able to
                    change their body size and whatever they see fit, to see how they look when their appearance is
                    altered.
